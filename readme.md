# Vanilla JS Web Framework

Another attempt at a tiny Vanilla JS framework (no transpiler required) which is just over 1KB in size when compressed.

As usual the aim is to facilitate reusable components whilst not drifting too far from normal JS syntax and HTML standards.

Unlike previous similar projects I've worked on, the driver of this framework is entirely JS with no additional controls available from within HTML. This is to simplify the process of using the framework, making it more consistent between implementations.  

**Default App Variables and Methods**

```javascript
a.load(view_location, optional_view_name) //load a view to be used, view name, used to call a view, is optional and will default to the filename minus the extension
a.v(view_name, optional_view_data) //
a.view(view_name, optional_view_data) //same as above

a.render(optional_target, output) // if only output is provided then the output will be renedered to to the app target (usually document.body)  

a.scripts() //Run all queued scripts from views generated with `a.v()` or `a.view()`. Views need to have been added to the page before running this. This method is likely to be removed/changed to simplify implementation

a.find(css_style_query) //a query selector which searches the app target (by defaul the `document`), works like document.querySelector
a.findAll(css_style_query) //a query selector which searches the app target (by defaul the `document`), works like document.querySelectorAll
```

**Default View Variables and Methods**

In addition to any variables set in the `view.values` section, each view has access to the following:

```javascript
v.self //a reference to the view HTMLElement
v.find(css_style_query) //a query selector which searches this view, works like v.self.querySelector
v.findAll(css_style_query) //a query selector which searches this view, works like v.self.querySelectorAll

v._uid //a unique id which each view is given e.g. `au-1`. This value is incremented as opposed to randmized for cleaner HTML output
v.selector //a css selector based on the unique id e.g. `.au-1` which could also be used in JS if need be
v.output() //does not exist by default but is the recommended way to provide output from a view
```

**Retrieving Child View Data**

When a view is added and it's script ran, the actual HTML Element output by that view will hold a handy `this` variable that holds the view values. This can be used to easily export held or generated data from a child view:

Output method added inside of view script:
```javascript
v.output = () => {
    return {
        text: v.find('input').value,
        done: v.self.classList.contains('done'),
    }
}
```

Running the output method and returning it's data for a single view from outside the component:
```javascript
let result = v.find('li').this.output()
```

Running the output method and returning it's data for a multiple views from outside the component:
```javascript
let results = Object.values(v.findAll('li')).map(item => item.this.output())
```






**An Example of a View**

```javascript
export default {
    //sets the element type - handy to avoid div soup!
    element: v => {
        return `div`
    },
    //set additional default values for this view
    values: v => {
        return {
        }
    },
    //enter any css here. ${v.selector} is a class selector that is unique to this element
    style: v => {
        return `
        ${v.selector} {
            
        }
        `
    },
    //the default HTML view to show
    view: v => {
        return ``
    },
    //script which runs when the element is added to the page from the `a.render` method
    script: v => {

    }
}
```


**A Basic Stylized Button View**
```javascript
export default {
    element: v => {
        return `button`
    },
    values: v => {
        return {
            text: 'Submit',
            counter: 0
        }
    },
    style: v => {
        return `
        ${v.selector} {
            background-color: white;
            border-radius: 1em;
            padding: 0.5em;
            margin: 0.5em;
            border: 0;
            box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px lightgray, -5px -5px 10px white;
            transition: all 0.2s ease;
        }
        ${v.selector}:hover {
            box-shadow: 5px 5px 20px lightgray, -5px -5px 20px white;
        }
        ${v.selector}:active {
            scale: 0.97;
        }
        `
    },
    view: v => {
        return `${v.text} - <span></span> ðŸ˜Š`
    },
    script: v => {

        v.update = () => {
            v.find('span').innerText = `Clicked ${v.counter} time${v.counter!==1?'s':''}`
        }
        v.update()

        v.self.addEventListener('click',() => {
            v.counter++
            v.update()
        })

    }
}
```

Using the above view to generate a page with 10 buttons:

```javascript
    a.ready(() => {

        let output = ``
        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            output += a.v('button', {text: 'Button ' + (i+1)})
        }

        a.render(
            output
        )
    })
```

**TODO:**

[ ] The script queue may be processed early (before the HTML is added) if using multiple asynchronous `a.render` calls. Make script queues unique to their caller

[ ] `v.refresh` helper method for regenerating a view with any updated variables. This will likely not support nested views.

[ ] Make view object classes optional in case they're not needed.

[ ] Move view css to a separate output section. They are currently attached to the HTML output of each component
